* MyBB Vector Smilies Changelog *

* Version 1.1.1 - Color Harmony & Visual Refinements, July 19, 2025:

In this update, the element color for all yellow-based smilies was changed from #292f33 to #433410. Elements in all colored smilies also had their color #292f33 replaced with corresponding colors by lowering the L value in the HSL system. Additionally, visual changes affected many individual smilies, which includes: adjustment of element shapes, correction of individual element placements, change of color gradient directions, addition of some details, and changes to individual element colors. In total, individual changes, besides the global color replacement, affected 12 smilies.

* Version 1.1.0 - Visual Update & Expansion, July 18, 2025:

In this release, I've not only addressed some graphical element fixes but also enhanced the overall visual composition of the smilies, ensuring they align with contemporary design sensibilities and user expectations.

   - Visual refinement for rolleyes.svg: the smiley's smile was slightly adjusted.
   - Visual refinement for shy.svg: the smiley's smile was slightly adjusted.
   - Visual refinement for huh.svg (huh_d.svg): the question marks above the smiley were slightly lowered.
   - Visual refinement for angel.svg: the color of the wings and the halo above the smiley were changed.
   - Visual refinement for sick.svg: the pupil of the left eye was brought above the layers (this was a minor non-critical issue).
   - Visual refinement for censored.svg: the spacing between the frame characters (#%!&) was aligned.
   - Visual refinement for heart.svg: the color gradient was slightly adjusted.
   - All elements in all smilies have been precisely horizontally centered relative to the smiley's circle.
   - The outer outline of all smilies was removed, after which the size of all smilies was increased to 21 pixels. This allowed for a visual enlargement of all smilies (their internal graphic elements) within the same viewBox.
   - The black color (#000) is no longer used in the smilies. This color created a very high contrast with other colors used in the smilies, which was especially noticeable at the standard 21-pixel smiley size. Instead of black, a new color - #292f33 - is now used. This color provides an excellent "soft" transition between colors and eliminates such a sharp contrast with others. It harmonizes perfectly with various colored smilies.
   - 5 new smilies have been added: Frozen (frozen.svg), Hot (hot.svg), ZZZ (zzz.svg), Like (like.svg), and Unlike (unlike.svg). This increases the total number of smilies to 40 (25 standard set smilies and 15 additional smilies).

* Version 1.0.2 - Visual Refinement and SVG Code Optimization, July 16, 2025:

   - Visual refinement for dead.svg: the tongue has been stretched downwards by 0.5 pixels for an improved visual appearance.
   - Visual refinement for censored.svg: characters within the black frame are now vertically centered.
   - Visual refinement for confused.svg: the mouth curve (sine wave) has been adjusted to ensure perfect symmetry for a cleaner visual appearance.
   - Visual refinement for wtf.svg: the mouth curve (sine wave) has been adjusted to ensure perfect symmetry for a cleaner visual appearance.
   - Visual refinement for dodgy.svg: the mouth line has been adjusted to a symmetrical curve for improved visual consistency and appearance.
   - SVG smilies code optimization: comprehensive optimization of all smiley SVG code has been performed. This has allowed for a reduction in the weight of each smiley by approximately half without any visual graphic changes. This improvement will significantly speed up smiley loading times and enhance overall performance.

* Version 1.0.1 - Visual Refinement, July 14, 2025:

   - Visual refinement for biggrin.svg: lowered the bottom node of the smile contour by 0.1 pixels for improved appearance and to conceal slightly protruding side arcs.

* Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release, July 13, 2025:

   - Initial release of the MyBB Vector Smilies set.
   - Includes the main set of 24 vectorized smilies from the standard MyBB 1.8.x smilie set.
   - Features 1 additional 'huh' smiley specifically designed for dark themes.
   - Contains 10 additional smilies, expanding the variety of expressions.
   - All smilies are in SVG format, maintaining 21px original raster size.
